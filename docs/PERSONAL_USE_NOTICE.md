# Personal Use and Distribution Notice

## Scope
- This software is developed for personal use and technical experimentation.
- It is not investment advice, brokerage service, or guaranteed-profit software.

## Risk Notice
- Real-money trading can result in partial or total capital loss.
- Exchange outages, API failures, latency, and market gaps can cause unexpected behavior.
- You are solely responsible for all trading decisions and losses.

## Operational Minimums
- Start from `PAPER` / `dry_run` and verify logs/reports before live mode.
- Use environment variables for API keys (`UPBIT_ACCESS_KEY`, `UPBIT_SECRET_KEY`).
- Keep `config/config.json` API fields empty; runtime is env-key driven.
- Use a low-balance account and strict loss limits for live tests.

## If You Sell This (e.g., freelance marketplace)
- Clearly state:
  - personal-use/experimental nature
  - no profit guarantee
  - user responsibility for exchange/account/legal compliance
- Provide setup docs, risk limits, and safe default preset (`safe`) as default.

## Recommended Documents to Include with Delivery
- `README.md`
- `docs/STRICT_GATE_RUNBOOK_2026-02-13.md`
- this notice (`docs/PERSONAL_USE_NOTICE.md`)
