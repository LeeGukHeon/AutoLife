# Real Trading Validation Report

Date: 2026-02-13 (local)

## Scope
- Stability checks for `myOrder` WebSocket in `dry_run`.
- Backtest matrix across all CSV datasets in `data/backtest`.
- Readiness gate for live-profit deployment.

## Key Fixes Applied Before Validation
- Fixed `BacktestEngine::getResult()` to compute:
  - `total_trades` from actual trade history
  - `winning_trades` from actual realized PnL records
- Added machine-readable backtest output:
  - `AutoLifeTrading.exe --backtest <file> --json`
- Added automated readiness script:
  - `scripts/validate_readiness.ps1`
- Fixed critical capital-accounting bug in `RiskManager::enterPosition()`:
  - cash now deducts `(invested_amount + entry_fee)` on entry.

## Stability Snapshot (dry_run)
- Observed:
  - `myOrder WS connected`: present
  - occasional `End of file` disconnect after long-lived connection
  - immediate reconnect behavior works (`retry in 0s` seen)
- No fatal runtime errors observed in the sampled run window.

## Backtest Matrix Result
Generated by:
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate_readiness.ps1`

Artifacts:
- `build/Release/logs/backtest_matrix_summary.csv`
- `build/Release/logs/readiness_report.json`

Summary:
- `dataset_total = 11`
- `dataset_evaluated = 2` (datasets with `total_trades >= 30`)
- `profitable_datasets = 1`
- `strict_pass_datasets = 1`
- `profitable_ratio = 0.50`
- `is_ready_for_live_by_backtest = false`

Readiness gates:
- profitable ratio `>= 0.60`
- strict pass datasets `>= 2`

Current status:
- Failed both gates.

## Conclusion
Current codebase is **not yet validated as “good profit-ready” for real-money deployment**.

## Next Required Steps
1. Increase validated dataset coverage (more realistic market regimes, more symbols).
2. Implement walk-forward validation (train/validate windows) and gate on OOS metrics.
3. Add fill/slippage model realism for backtest/live parity.
4. Keep live runs in `dry_run` with long-horizon stability logging before capital scaling.
5. Continue string/log encoding cleanup in `TradingEngine.cpp` and strategy modules.
